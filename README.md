Before running this project make sure to add allow the dependencies required by it.
1-I am listing down all the dependencies used by me :) :)


//// meteor add accounts-ui   	
//// meteor add accounts-password
//// meteor add twbs:bootstrap
//// meteor add iron:router
//// meteor add acemtp:meta-extractor 
//// meteor add arkham:comments-ui
/////meteor add easy:search


Made a recommendation tool from scratch using regex and simple mongo.find() function.

2-Have completed all the challenges put up in my coursera assessment.
--->>> ALL THE TASKS ARE DONE<<<<---
    Users can register and login.
    Users can post new websites if they are logged in. Websites posted by users should have an URL and a description.
    Users can up and down vote webpages by clicking a plus or a minus button.
    Websites should be listed with the most up voted site first.
    The listing page shows when the website was added and how many up and down votes it has.
    Users can move to a detail page for a website (using routing).
    On the detail page, users can post comments about a webpage, and they are displayed below the description of the webpage.

You can gain a further 30% by implementing one or more of the following features:

Challenge 1: Automatic information

Can you use the HTTP package for Meteor to pull in information about the posted web links automatically, so the user does not need to enter anything other than the URL?

Challenge 2: Search function

Implement a search function that allows the user to search within the listed sites for key words

Challenge 3: Website recommender

Can you recommend websites to users based on things they have up voted and commented on? E.g. if I up vote a site entitled ‘Tofu recipes’, it would recommend other sites with ‘tofu’ and ‘recipe’ in their titles or descriptions.

3-Had fun doing all those stuffs. Thanks to all the packages available on Atmosphere.js which I did use like easySearch,bootstrap,etc.


4-I am not adding any security features rightnow as its not mentioned in the assessment as necessary.Though I'll do that later but not for now :) .
